# Where did these come from?


---

### LSAT.js

A simple JavaScript SAT solver, see (http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gregory/sat/) for a live demo & more information.

---

### algebrite.js

A js CAS, see (http://algebrite.org) for a live demo and documentation.

*Lurch modifications*
 - recompiled algebrite with the command 
   ```
   cat runtime/defs.coffee  
   sources/*.coffee 
   runtime/alloc.coffee 
   runtime/find.coffee 
   runtime/init.coffee 
   runtime/mcmp.coffee 
   runtime/otherCFunctions.coffee 
   runtime/count.coffee 
   runtime/run.coffee 
   runtime/stack.coffee 
   runtime/symbol.coffee 
   runtime/zombocom.coffee 
   runtime/freeze.coffee | 
   ../coffeescript/bin/coffee -sc --bare \ > 
   ../../dependencies/algebrite.js
   ```
   script to create a --bare version of algebrite.js in the dependencies folder.
 - added 
   ```
   const exports = { }
   ``` 
   to the top of the file to allow importing it
 - commented out the declaration of the variable, `bigInt`,
   (since it's now imported instead of required)
 - changed 
    ```
    bigInt = require('big-integer');
    ```
    to 
    ```
    import bigInt from './BigInteger.js'
    ```
 - added 
   ```
   export default exports
   ``` 
   to the bottom of the file
 - note that there is no need to do any of this if you just 
   use the version that is in the `dependencies` folder of 
   the git repo.

 ### BigInteger.js

 Algebrite depends on the node module `big-integer`, for 
 arbitrary precision integers. 
 See (https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-integer) for details.

 *Lurch modifications*
  - added 
    ```
    export default bigInt
    ```
    to the bottom of the file so it can be imported by our
    modified Algebrite.
