// This file was autogenerated as part of an export process from an old repository.

// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables x P y)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(Subproof x , (@apply P x))  (Subproof a , (r a a))
	(forall y , (@apply P y))    (forall b , (r b b))
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		x  a
		P  (@lambda v , (r v v))
		y  b
	)
)
