     * In computer programming, the notion of variable scope is common.  A line
     * of code can "see" a variable (or is in the scope of that variable) if it
     * appears later than the variable's declaration and at a deeper level of
     * block nesting.  We have the same concept within Structures, and we call
     * it both "scope" and "accessibility."  We say that any later Structure is
     * "in the scope of" an earlier one, or equivalently, the earlier one "is
     * accessible to" the later one, if the nesting of intermediate structures
     * permits it in the usual way.
     * 
     * More specifically, a Structure `X` is in the scope of precisely the
     * following other Structures: all of `X`'s previous siblings, all of
     * `X.parent()`'s previous siblings (if `X.parent()` exists), all of
     * `X.parent().parent()`'s previous siblings (if `X.parent().parent()`
     * exists), and so on.  In particular, a Structure is not in its own scope,
     * nor in the scope of any of its other ancestors.
     * 
     * The one exception to what's stated above is the reflexive case, whether
     * `X.isAccessibleTo(X)`.  By default, this is false, because we typically
     * think of `X.isAccessibleTo(Y)` as answering the question, "Can `Y`
     * justify itself by citing `X`?" and we do not wish that relation to be
     * reflexive.  However, `X.isInTheScopeOf(X)` would typically be considered
     * true, because a variable declaration is the beginning of the scope of
     * that variable.  So we provide the second parameter, `reflexive`, for
     * customizing this behavior, and we have that, for any boolean value `b`,
     * `X.isAccessibleTo(Y,b)` if and only if `Y.isInTheScopeOf(X,b)`.
     * 
     * @param {Structure} other - The Structure to which we're asking whether
     *   the current one is accessible.  If this parameter is not a Structure,
     *   the result is undefined.
     * @param {boolean} reflexive - Whether the relation should be reflexive,
     *   that is, whether it should judge `X.isAccessibleTo(X)` to be true.
     * @return {boolean} Whether this Structure is accessible to `other`.
