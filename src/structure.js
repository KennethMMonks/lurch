     * block nesting.  We have the same concept within Structures, and we call
     * it both "scope" and "accessibility."  We say that any later Structure is
     * "in the scope of" an earlier one, or equivalently, the earlier one "is
     * accessible to" the later one, if the nesting of intermediate structures
     * permits it in the usual way.
     *

     * justify itself by citing `X`?" and we do not wish that relation to be
     * reflexive.  However, `X.isInTheScopeOf(X)` would typically be considered
     * true, because a variable declaration is the beginning of the scope of
     * that variable.  So we provide the second parameter, `reflexive`, for
