// The following function call teaches the second-order-matching module
// imported from npm the specific expression API used in this repository.

/**
 * The matching module we [import from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/second-order-matching)
 * requires us to specify how it should interact with the mathematical
 * expressions in the client project.  We make a call to the matching module's
 * `setAPI()` function and provide it with all the tools it needs to interface
 * with {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} instances.  We document in this
 * namespace all those tools.
 * 
 * To use this in other code, import it with code something like
 * `import Matching from '../src/matching.js'` (or whatever path is required
 * based on where you're importing it from).  In the rest of this
 * documentation, we assume you have issued a call like the one above and thus
 * have access to a `Matching` object representing this module.
 * 
 * It will contain the following five members, all from the npm package linked
 * to above.
 * 
 *  * `Matching.Constraint`, used for constructing constraints.  A constraint
 *    is a pair of expressions, the left of which may contain metavariables
 *    and is called the "pattern."  It is a constraint in that we use such
 *    pairs to describe the problems the matching module must solve for us.
 *    The given pattern must be instantiated in some way to equal the given
 *    expression.  To mark a {@link Symbol Symbol} as a metavariable, simply
 *    call `s.makeIntoA( 'metavariable' )`, using the existing
 *    {@link MathConcept.makeIntoA function from MathConcepts}.
 *  * `Matching.ConstraintList`, used to collect multiple constraints into a
 *    list, which has two purposes.  It can be used to pose a matching problem
 *    to the matching module, and it can also be used to report a solution
 *    back from the module to the client.  When reporting a solution, all the
 *    patterns will be atomic metavariables.
 *  * `Matching.MatchingChallenge`, used to both pose and solve matching
 *    problems.  The code block below shows examples.
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // Let's say we want to check the rule "from A and B, conclude and(A,B)"
 * // against the instance "from X and or(Y,Z), conclude and(X,or(Y,Z))."
 * 
 * // First, create all the ingredients
 * const A = new Symbol( 'A' ).makeIntoA( 'metavariable' )
 * const B = new Symbol( 'B' ).makeIntoA( 'metavariable' )
 * const AandB = new Application( new Symbol( 'and' ), A.copy(), B.copy() )
 * const X = new Symbol( 'X' )
 * const YorZ = LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(or Y Z)' )[0]
 * const XandYorZ = LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(and X (or Y Z))' )[0]
 * 
 * // Next, set up the problem
 * const challenge = new Matching.MatchingChallenge( [ A,     X ],
 *                                                   [ B,     YorZ ],
 *                                                   [ AandB, XandYorZ ] )
 * 
 * // Finally, get the set of solutions
 * const solutions = challenge.getSolutions()
 * 
 * // If solutions.length == 0, the challenge has no solutions.
 * // If solutions.length > 1, the challenge has many solutions.
 * // In this case, solutions.length == 1.
 * const only = solutions[0]
 * // And if we checked, we would find that it was a constraint list
 * // containing the constraints (A,X) and (B,or(Y,Z)) (not necessarily in
 * // that order).
 * // There is a (mostly undocumented) Matching.display function that can
 * // print constraints, constraint lists, and expressions, so we could do:
 * console.log( Matching.display( only ) )
 * // And we would see:  { (A,X), (B,(or Y Z)) }
 * ```
 * 
 * All the functions documented below in this namespace are not for use in the
 * LDE.  Rather, they are created to give the matching module (which is not
 * part of the LDE) the language it needs (in terms of functions that already
 * exist in the LDE) to interface with things like {@link Symbol Symbols},
 * {@link Expression Expressions}, etc.  Thus the rest of this file is just
 * documenting the API we provide to the matching module, not the API for our
 * own use in the LDE.  For that, see the documentation of all the other
 * classes such as {@link Symbol Symbol}, {@link Expression Expression}, etc.
