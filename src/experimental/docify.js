//
//  (KEEP OUT!  Work in progress.)
//
//  This file is still under construction and subject to frequent change.
//
//  In the current implementation of global n-compact validation we currently
//  make many simplifying assumptions about the nature of a document.  But they
//  are hard to keep track of when just defined, but not codified.  So we
//  include here routines for the phase of processing that moves things around
//  and computes js attributes that are required for validation.

// Process the user's theorems 
//
// If a user specifies that a claim Environment is a Theorem, he is declaring
// that he wants to use it as a Rule after that (if we enable the option to
// allow users to enter Theorems... otherwise just let them enter them as
// ordinary claim environments like proofs that aren't marked asA 'Theorem' but
// can be formatted as such). But we want to mark his theorem as valid or
// invalid just like any other proof in addition to using it as a Rule.  To
// accomplish this, we make an invisible copy of the Theorem immediately
// following the theorem, make that a formula, and label it as a Rule for future
// use.  This does not have to be done if the Theorem has no metavariables as a
// Rule because it would be redundant. When a Rule copy of the user's Theorem is
// inserted it does not have to be marked as a given since it has no prop form,
// but its instantiations do.  We flag the inserted Rule version of the Theorem as
// .userThm to distinguish it from ordinary Rules.
//
// This has to be done after processing Shorthands and moving Declares to the
// top so the user's theorems are in the scope of declared constants in the
// library, which then prevents them from being metavariables.
