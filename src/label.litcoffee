# Label Structures

This file defines a particular subclass of the
[Structure](structure.litcoffee) class.  It is supposed to model the idea of
a label in mathematics.  (For example, in LaTeX one might use the `\label{}`
command to label an expression, section, list item, and so on.)

If we are running in node we need to load the `Structure` class.

    if require? then { Structure } = require './structure'

Now we can extend it to our new class.

    class Label extends Structure

We first need to register this subclass with the global list of subclasses
of the Structure` class (see the discussion regarding [Serialization and
Deserialization](structure.litcoffee#serialization-and-deserialization) in
the `Structure` class documentation.)

        className : Structure.addSubclass 'Label', Label

We will add a validation routine and perhaps other methods here later.
