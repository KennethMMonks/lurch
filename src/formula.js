/**
 * A {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} can be converted into a formula by
 * replacing any subset of its {@link Symbol Symbols} with metavariables.
 * Recall that a metavariable can be any symbol, but with
 * {@link module:Matching.metavariable a specific attribute} set to "true."
 * 
 * Which {@link Symbol Symbols} should be converted into metavariables?  Any
 * one that is not in the scope of a {@link Declaration Declaration} of that
 * same {@link Symbol Symbol}.  For example, if we consider the
 * {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} indicated by the
 * {@link LogicConcept.fromPutdown putdown notation} `{ :(= a b) (= b a) }`
 * and we assume it is in the scope of a {@link Declaration Declaration} of
 * the `=` {@link Symbol Symbol}, but not of the `a` or `b` {@link Symbol
 * Symbols}.  Then converting `{ :(= a b) (= b a) }` to a formula would
 * produce a copy in which each instance of `a` and `b` have had their
 * metavariable attribute set to "true" (via a call to the
 * {@link LogicConcept#makeIntoA makeIntoA()} member).
 * 
 * @param {LogicConcept} LC - the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} to convert
 *   into a formula
 * @returns {LogicConcept} a structural copy of `LC`, except with the relevant
 *   {@link Symbol Symbol} atoms converted into
 *   {@link module:Matching.metavariable metavariables}

 * This function performs exactly that operation, with two exceptions.
 * 
 * First, this function does not check to ensure that the domain of the given
 * `instantiation` matches the {@link Formula.domain domain} of the given
 * `formula`.  If that is important to the caller, they should verify that
 * themselves in advance, using an {@link Set#equals equality check} between
 * the two sets.
 * 
 * Second, this function also applies {@link module:Matching.fullBetaReduce
 * beta reduction} to the result before returning it (if necessary) because
 * the instantiation may have introduced an explicit expression function in a
 * position where it should be applied to its arguments.  Note the warnings in
 * the beta reduction documentation about infinite loops.
 * 
 * @param {LogicConcept} formula - the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} to
 *   instantiate with the given `instantiation`
 * @param {Substitution|Solution|Object|Map} instantiation - either a
 *   {@link Substitution Substitution} instance (which describes a single
 *   metavariable's replacement) or a {@link Solution Solution} instance
 *   (which describes the substitution of zero or more metavariables) or a
