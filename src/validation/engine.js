 *  * The return value should be the validation results for that conclusion.
 * 
 * That result will be written into the conclusion using the
 * {@link module:Validation.setResult setResult()}
 * function.
 * 
 * Each tool gets stored under a name chosen by the client, so that the tool
 * can be referred to later by this name as a unique ID.  Installing another
 * tool later with the same name overwrites the previous.
 * 
 * If this is the first tool installed in this module, it will immediately

 * documentation for further details.

 *    officially supported ones at the moment are `"valid"` (meaning the user's

 *    and `"indeterminate"` (meaning that Lurch cannot find the answer, perhaps

 *  * `reason` - any string representing the reason for why the validation
 *    result was what it was.  We leave it up to the author of the validation
 *    tool how to use this attribute, but we recommend using short English
 *    phrases as error codes that can be looked up in a larger dictionary of
 *    detailed descriptions.  For example, you might use `"No such reason"` or

 *  * Any other keys in the object are optional, and can be used at the

 * ```json
