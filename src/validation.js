/**
 * ## What is Validation?
 * 
 * Validation is the process of computing feedback for the user about the
 * validity of their reasoning.  It can be run on any {@link LogicConcept
 * LogicConcept}, from a small one that represents only a single equation of
 * arithmetic up to a large one that represents an entire document containing
 * many theorems and proofs.
 * 
 * The word "reasoning" is used in a very broad sense here; there are many
 * ways one can define validation and many meanings one can ascribe to symbols
 * in a document (or no meaning at all in a toy system).  But we will call the
 * user's work "reasoning" because typically Lurch will be grading actual
 * mathematical proofs, and the user will be doing some reasoning in any case
 * in order to use even a toy system, even if the system itself has no
 * meaning.
 * 
 * Because there can be many different ways to validate a
 * {@link Environment#conclusions conclusion()}, this module lets the client
 * {@link module:Validation.installTool install any number of validation
 * tools}.  Some validation tools will be installed in this module by default,
 * when the module is loaded, but the client can add others.
 * 
 * The user can also specify options for how validation tools should operate,
 * either global options for this whole module, or per-conclusion options, all
 * using the
 * {@link module:Validation.setOptions setOptions()} function.
 * 
 * @module Validation

 * function with the following signature:
 * 
 *  * Argument 1 is a {@link Environment#conclusions conclusion} to be

 *  * Argument 2 is an options object, combining the module-level validation
 *    options with any options stored in the conclusion, with those in the
 *    conclusion superceding module-level options.
 *  * The return value should be the validation results for that conclusion.
 * 
 * That result will be written into the conclusion using the
 * {@link module:Validation.setResult setResult()}
 * function.
 * 
 * Each tool gets stored under a name chosen by the client, so that the tool
 * can be referred to later by this name as a unique ID.  Installing another
 * tool later with the same name overwrites the previous.
 * 
 * If this is the first tool installed in this module, it will immediately
 * become the default.  You can change this later using the
 * {@link module:Validation.setOptions setOptions()} function; see its
 * documentation for further details.

 * @function
 * @param {string} name the name by which this tool will be called, and under

 *    officially supported ones at the moment are `"valid"` (meaning the user's
