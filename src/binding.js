/**
 * Many mathematical expressions include "dummy variables," also called "bound
 * variables."  For example, a summation from `i=1` to `n` uses `i` as a
 * "dummy" or "bound" variable.  An integral ending in "dx" has x as a bound
 * variable.  There are many other examples, including (but not limited to)
 * the following.
 * 
 *  * indexed sums, products, unions, and intersections throughout mathematics
 *  * for set-builder notation like `{ x+y | 0 < x < y }`
 *  * existentially and universally quantified expressions, such as
 *    "for all x > 0, |x|=x."
 *  * lambda functions from computer science
 * 
 * We say that such expressions "bind" the dummy/bound variable, and we
 * therefore call such expressions Bindings, and implement them in this class.
 * 
 * These were inspired by a structure of the same name defined in
 * {@link https://openmath.org/about/ the OpenMath Standard}, but the reader
 * is not expected to read that standard; we define in this documentation our
 * version of what a Binding is.
 * 
 * A Binding is defined by a sequence of children, each of which is an
 * {@link Expression}.  These children must meet specific requirements, given
 * below.
 * 
 *  * The first child will be the operator or quantifier that binds the
 *    variable(s).  (Note that a single operator can bind multiple variables,
 *    such as when we say "for all x, y, and z in Q...")  This first child is
 *    often called the "head."
 *  * Following that operator will be the sequence of bound variables, all as
 *    siblings of the operator, that is, children of the Binding.
 *  * Following the bound variables will be exactly one final expression, the
 *    "body."  This is what "sits inside" the operator, such as the integrand
 *    in an integral, the summand in a summation, the inner statement in a
 *    quantification, etc.
 * 
 * Consequently, a Binding will always have at least three children, because
 * the head is required, at least one bound variable is required, and the body
 * is required.  THe bound variables must all be {@link Symbol Symbols}.  The
 * constructor defined below enforces this.
 * 
 * The head may be a single symbol (such as the universal quantifier) or it
 * may be a compound expression (such as an integral with lower and upper
 * limits, or a summation with lower and upper limits, or a union with an
 * index set over which the union is to be taken, etc.).
 * 
 * This head {@link Expression} is not technically inside the scope of the
 * Binding.  By this, we mean that any instance of the bound variables that
 * appears in the head technically sits outside the Binding.  Although this
 * would be extremely confusing notation, and thus is almost never relevant,
 * one can imagine nested summations that both use the index `i`, where the
 * bounds on the inner sum are written to include the `i` from the outer sum.
 * There is a natural and sensible interpretation of such notation, even
 * though we never use it in practice, because it is needlessly confusing.

    /**
     * Construct a new Binding instance from the given head (requried
     * {@link Expression}), list of bound variables (one or more
     * {@link Symbol Symbols}), and body (required {@link Expression}).  For
     * example, to construct "for all x, -1 < x^2", you might do something
     * like the following.  Let us assume that `forAll` is the universal
     * quantifier (perhaps defined as a {@link Symbol}), `x` is the
     * {@link Symbol} `x`, and we have symbols `lessThan` and `power`.
     * 
     * ```
     * new Binding( forAll, x,
     *     new Application( lessThan, Symbol( -1 ),
     *         new Application( power, x, Symbol( 2 ) ) ) )
     * ```
     * 
     * To construct the summation from `i=1` to `n` of `i^2`, we might do
     * something like the following, assuming {@link Symbol Symbols} `i`,
     * `n`, and `Sum`.  This might be read as "the sum from 1 to `n`, using
     * bound variable `i`, of the formula `i^2`."
     * 
     * ```
     * new Binding(
     *     new Application( Sum, Symbol( 1 ), n ),
     *     i,
     *     new Application( power, i, Symbol( 2 ) )
     * )

     * Note that while it is possible later to remove children from a Binding
     * so that it does not have the required structure of head-variables-body,
     * this is likely to result in the members of this class malfunctioning or
     * throwing errors.  Clients should not remove the necessary children of a
     * Binding; that is not supported.

     * list of bound variables, we do not explicitly forbid it.

     * @param {Expression} head - The operator or quantifier that is being
     *   used to bind variables in the context of the body expression.  This
     *   argument is required, and must be an {@link Expression}.
     * @param  {...Symbol} boundVars - The list of one or more variables that
     *   this expression binds.  Any nonempty sequence of
     *   {@link Symbol Symbols} is permitted; we make no distinction here
     *   between what mathematicians often call variables vs. constants.
     * @param {Expression} body - The interior of the Binding, whose meaning
     *   varies based on the `head`.  In a summation, this is the summand;
     *   in an integral, it is the integrand; etc.
     * @throws This constructor throws an error if the first or last argument
     *   (which will be interpreted as the head and body, respectively) are
     *   not both {@link Expression Expressions}, or if any of the arguments
     *   in between (the bound variables) are not {@link Symbol Symbols}, or
     *   if the list of bound variables is empty.
