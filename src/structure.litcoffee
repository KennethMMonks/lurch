# LDE Structures

The very generic word "structure" is used in the LDE to describe a subtree
of the LDE Document.  For more details on this, see
[the design overview docs](https://lurchmath.github.io/lde/site/overview/).

    exports.Structure = class Structure

## Unique IDs for instances

We want to be able to give instance of this class unique IDs.  To do so, we
will track those IDs in a class variable defined here, and provide class
methods for assigning and revoking IDs to instances.  IDs will be
nonnegative integers, and we will track them using an array.

        IDs : [ ]
        @instanceWithID : ( id ) -> Structure::IDs[id]
        @nextUnusedID : ->
            result = Structure::IDs.indexOf null
            if result >= 0 then result else Structure::IDs.length

The following two functions, which can be called in an instance to request a
new, unique ID, or to relinquish one back into the pool, are optional for
any given instance.  That is, it is not required that each instance have an
ID.  But this system ensures that if IDs are assigned in this way, then they
will be globally unique for all instances.

Ensure that any instance that calls `getID` at some point later calls
`releaseID`, or the `IDs` array will become enormous, a memory leak.

        getID : ->
            return if @ID?
            @ID = Structure.nextUnusedID()
            Structure::IDs[@ID] = this
        releaseID : ->
            if @ID?
                Structure::IDs[@ID] = null
                delete @ID
                while Structure::IDs[Structure::IDs.length-1] is null
                    Structure::IDs.pop()

## Constructor

The constructor body just initializes internal fields, but it accepts an
array of initial children as its argument.  Any non-Structure passed as an
argument is ignored.  See the next section for more details of child
structures.

        constructor : ( children... ) ->
            @computedAttributes = { }
            @externalAttributes = { }
            @parentNode = null
            @childList = [ ]
            for child in children
                @insertChild child, @childList.length

## Tree structure

Structures form a hierarchy, an n-ary tree.  We thus need functions for
inserting, removing, and querying parents and children.

First, the getters.  When querying the children, we make a copy of the list
so that clients can feel free to manipulate it without messing up the
integrity of the hierarchy.

        parent : -> @parentNode
        children : -> @childList[..]
        indexInParent : -> @parentNode?.childList?.indexOf this
        previousSibling : ->
            if ( index = @indexInParent() )?
                @parentNode.childList[index-1]
        nextSibling : ->
            if ( index = @indexInParent() )?
                @parentNode.childList[index+1]

Next, the setters.  There is no setter for the parent, because the parent
pointer of a structure S must be kept consistent with the children list of
the parent of S, and so we update both in the setters for children.

We permit removing children from parents, either with a method in the child
or in the parent.

        removeFromParent : ->
            if ( originalParent = @parentNode )?
                originalIndex = @indexInParent()
                @parentNode.childList.splice originalIndex, 1
                @parentNode = null
                @wasRemoved? originalParent, originalIndex
        removeChild : ( atIndex ) -> @childList[atIndex]?.removeFromParent()

We permit inserting a new child into the parent's child array at any valid
index (including the old length of the child array, which appends).  The
child to be inserted is first removed from any parent it has when this
method is called.  The default index is 0, so that a call of
`insertChild(x)` inserts it as the first child.

If the child to be inserted is an ancestor of this structure, then we
remove this structure from its parent, to obey the insertion command given
while still maintaining acyclicity in the tree structure.  If the child to
be inserted is this node itself, this function does nothing.

        insertChild : ( child, beforeIndex = 0 ) ->
            return unless child instanceof Structure and \
                child isnt this and \
                0 <= beforeIndex <= @childList.length
            walk = this
            while ( walk = walk.parent() )?
                if walk is child
                    @removeFromParent()
                    break
            child.removeFromParent()
            @childList = [
                @childList[...beforeIndex]...
                child
                @childList[beforeIndex...]...
            ]
            child.parentNode = this
            child.wasInserted?()

A convenient combination of the above methods is to replace a child with a
new structure, deparenting the old child and putting the replacement at the
same index in the same parent.

        replaceWith : ( other ) ->
            if ( originalParent = @parentNode )?
                originalIndex = @indexInParent()
                @removeFromParent()
                originalParent.insertChild other, originalIndex

Another possibly convenient utility is to make a copy of the Structure S
(or equivalently the subtree with root S).

        copy : ->
            S = new Structure
            S.computedAttributes = JSON.parse JSON.stringify @computedAttributes
            S.externalAttributes = JSON.parse JSON.stringify @externalAttributes
            S.childList = [C.copy() for C in @childList]

We can ask which of two structures comes earlier in their common ancestor,
under pre-order tree traversal, lowest-indexed children first.  The ordering
defined here is strict (`A.isEarlierThan A` is false).

        isEarlierThan : ( other ) ->
            if other not instanceof Structure then return undefined
            if other is this then return no

Get a list of all ancestors of the other structure.  If it is the root,
then I am strictly later than it, and we can return that now.

            ancestorsOfOther = [ other ]
            while ( nextAncestor = ancestorsOfOther[0].parent() )?
                ancestorsOfOther.unshift nextAncestor

Find my nearest ancestor that appears in that list.

            walk = this
            relevantAncestor = null
            while walk? and walk not in ancestorsOfOther
                relevantAncestor = walk
                walk = walk.parent()

If there was none, we are incomparable; return undefined.  If the nearest
ancestor was me, then other is one of my descendants, so I am earlier than
it.  If the nearest ancestor was the other structure, then the reverse is
true.

            if not walk? then return undefined
            if walk is this then return yes
            if walk is other then return no

Compare the child indices in the common ancestor to determine ordering.

            commonAncestorIndex = ancestorsOfOther.indexOf walk
            otherRelevantAncestor = ancestorsOfOther[commonAncestorIndex+1]
            myAncestorIndex = relevantAncestor.indexInParent()
            otherAncestorIndex = otherRelevantAncestor.indexInParent()
            myAncestorIndex < otherAncestorIndex

## Computed attributes

The dictionary of computed attributes has getters and setters that work on
keys or key-value pairs (respectively).  The intent is for them to store the
results of computations done by the LDE.  There is also a corresponding
"clear" function for deleting entries from the computed attributes
dictionary.

The client is permitted to use any keys they like here, but the `feedback`
key is special; see [the documentation
here](https://lurchmath.github.io/lde/site/phase0-structures/#methods-in-the-structure-class)
for details.

        getComputedAttribute : ( key ) -> @computedAttributes[key]
        setComputedAttribute : ( key, value ) ->
            if @computedAttributes[key] isnt value
                @computedAttributes[key] = value
                @wasChanged?()
        clearComputedAttributes : ( keys... ) ->
            if keys.length is 0 then keys = Object.keys @computedAttributes
            for key in keys
                if key of @computedAttributes
                    delete @computedAttributes[key]
                    @wasChanged?()

The default implementation of the `compute` member takes any number of keys
as string arguments, and runs them as member functions, storing the results
as computed attributes.  Arrays can be used to pass additional arguments.
Specifically:

 * `S.compute('foo')` means `S.setComputedAttribute('foo',S.foo())`.
 * `S.compute(['foo',1,2,3])` means
   `S.setComputedAttribute('foo',S.foo(1,2,3))`.
 * `S.compute(arg1,arg2,...)` means `S.compute(arg1)` and then
   `S.compute(arg2)` and so on.

More details re in [the documentation
here](https://lurchmath.github.io/lde/site/phase0-structures/#methods-in-the-structure-class).

        compute : ( args... ) ->
            for arg in args
                if arg not instanceof Array then arg = [ arg ]
                [ func, params... ] = arg
                @setComputedAttribute func, @[func] params...

## External attributes

The dictionary of external attributes has get/set/clear functions just as we
have for computed attributes.  The intent is for them to store data provided
by the client, and the LDE will not alter it.

        getExternalAttribute : ( key ) -> @externalAttributes[key]
        setExternalAttribute : ( key, value ) ->
            if @externalAttributes[key] isnt value
                @externalAttributes[key] = value
                @wasChanged?()
        clearExternalAttributes : ( keys... ) ->
            if keys.length is 0 then keys = Object.keys @externalAttributes
            for key in keys
                if key of @externalAttributes
                    delete @externalAttributes[key]
                    @wasChanged?()

External attributes can also be added with an `attr()` function that returns
the instance, thus supporting method chaining.  This is useful when
constructing objects of this class, especially for unit testing, using
code like `Structure( Structure().attr(...), ... )`.  It takes an object and
installs all of its key-value pairs as external attributes.

        attr : ( object ) ->
            @setExternalAttribute key, value for own key, value of object
            this

On the topic of conveniences for constructing instances, the following
method can be used at the top level of a nested set of constructor calls,
to traverse the final tree after constructing it, and performs the
convenience cleanup routines described within the function itself.

This is intended to be used when constructing large structures, as in
`result = Structure( ...lots of children... ).setup()`.

        setup : ->

Every structure and substructure will be given a unique ID.

            recurGetID = ( node ) ->
                node.getID()
                recurGetID child for child in node.children()
            recurGetID this

Every structure with an external attribute key "label for", "reason for", or
"premise for" and value X will be converted into a connection to node X of
type "label", "reason", or "premise", respectively.  Node X will be found by
seeking a node with attribute key "id" and value X.

All attributes with key id are then deleted.

Alternately the same keys could be associated with value "previous" or
"next" to indicate connection to a sibling, with no id required.

            targets = { }
            recurFindTargets = ( node ) ->
                if ( id = node.getExternalAttribute 'id' )?
                    targets[id] = node
                    node.clearExternalAttributes 'id'
                recurFindTargets child for child in node.children()
            recurFindTargets this
            recurConnect = ( node ) ->
                for attr in [ 'label', 'premise', 'reason' ]
                    if ( value = node.getExternalAttribute "#{attr} for" )?
                        if value is 'previous'
                            target = node.previousSibling()
                        else if value is 'next'
                            target = node.nextSibling()
                        else if targets.hasOwnProperty value
                            target = targets[value]
                        else
                            target = null
                        if target? then node.connectTo target, attr
                        node.clearExternalAttributes "#{attr} for"
                recurConnect child for child in node.children()
            recurConnect this

We then check all connections within this structure for consistency, and
return the structure for use in chaining.

            @fillOutConnections()
            this

## Connections

Structures may have connections among them, specified using external
attributes.  The documentation
[here](https://lurchmath.github.io/lde/site/phase0-structures/#connections)
covers the concept in detail.  We provide the following functions to make it
easier for clients to create, remove, or query connections.

### Making connections consistent

The first function ensures that all connections in a hierarchy are properly
recorded twice, once as outgoing from the source, and once as incoming to
the target.  This consistency is assumed by the query functions.  Run this
on the root of your hierarchy if you have any reason to believe that the
connections may not be stored consistently.

Because connections depend on IDs, this routine does nothing if this
Structure does not already have an ID.

        fillOutConnections : ->

Recur on children, but if this object has no ID, we can't go beyond that.

            child.fillOutConnections() for child in @childList
            if not @ID? then return

We define an internal function for converting multisets of target-type pairs
from array representation to an easier-to-work-with object representation,
and then an inverse of that function.  These make the rest of this function
eaiser to write.

The "array" form is as in the docs linked to above,
`[ [targID, connType], ... ]`.  The "object" form maps target keys to
objects whose key-value pairs are type-count pairs, where the count is the
number of times the `[targID,connType]` pair appeared in the array.
That is, `{ targID: { type: count, ... }, ... }`.

            arrayToObject = ( array ) ->
                result = { }
                for connection in array
                    [ target, type ] = connection
                    result[target] ?= { }
                    result[target][type] ?= 0
                    result[target][type]++
                result
            objectToArray = ( object ) ->
                result = [ ]
                for own target, moreData of object
                    for own type, count of moreData
                        for i in [1..count]
                            result.push [ Number( target ), type ]
                result

Now find all my outgoing connections, and ensure they exist in at least the
same quantity on both sides.

            outs = arrayToObject \
                ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
            for own target, moreData of outs
                continue unless ( T = Structure.instanceWithID target )?
                targetIns = arrayToObject \
                    ( T.getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) ? [ ]
                targetIns[@ID] ?= { }
                for own type, count of moreData
                    moreData[type] = targetIns[@ID][type] =
                        Math.max count, targetIns[@ID][type] ? 0
                T.setExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn',
                    objectToArray targetIns

Repeat the same exrecise for my incoming connections.

            ins = arrayToObject \
                ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) ? [ ]
            for own source, moreData of ins
                continue unless ( S = Structure.instanceWithID source )?
                sourceOuts = arrayToObject \
                    ( S.getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
                sourceOuts[@ID] ?= { }
                for own type, count of moreData
                    moreData[type] = sourceOuts[@ID][type] =
                        Math.max count, sourceOuts[@ID][type] ? 0
                S.setExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut',
                    objectToArray sourceOuts

### Making consistent connections

Another way to ensure that connections among structures in a hierarchy are
consistent is to avoid directly editing the external attribute containing
the connections data, and instead use the following two convenience
functions for creating or deleting connections.

The first one creates a new connection of the given type from this structure
to another.  Because there may be multiple connections of a given type
between the same two structures, calling this repeatedly adds new
connections.

These functions do nothing if either of the two structures is lacking an ID.
They return true on success and false on failure.

        connectTo : ( otherStructure, connectionType ) ->
            return no unless @ID? and \
                otherStructure instanceof Structure and otherStructure.ID?
            outs = ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
            ins = ( otherStructure.getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) \
                ? [ ]
            outs.push [ otherStructure.ID, connectionType ]
            ins.push [ @ID, connectionType ]
            @setExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut', outs
            otherStructure.setExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn', ins
            yes

The delete function does nothing if there is no connection to delete.

        disconnectFrom : ( otherStructure, connectionType ) ->
            return no unless @ID? and \
                otherStructure instanceof Structure and otherStructure.ID?
            outs = ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
            ins = ( otherStructure.getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) \
                ? [ ]
            outIndex = inIndex = 0
            while outIndex < outs.length and \
                  ( outs[outIndex][0] isnt otherStructure.ID or \
                    outs[outIndex][1] isnt connectionType )
                outIndex++
            if outIndex is outs.length then return no
            while inIndex < ins.length and \
                  ( ins[inIndex][0] isnt @ID or \
                    ins[inIndex][1] isnt connectionType )
                inIndex++
            if inIndex is ins.length then return no
            outs.splice outIndex, 1
            ins.splice inIndex, 1
            @setExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut', outs
            otherStructure.setExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn', ins
            yes

### Querying connections

The following functions are some conveniences for querying what connections
exist from a given structure object to/from others.

First, we can fetch all connections of a given type that exit a given
structure object.  It returns a multiset of target structure IDs, in the
form of an array with possible repeated entries.  If the user omits the
type, then all outgoing connections are returned, not as targets only, but
as target-type pairs, `[[targetID,typeString],...]`.

        allConnectionsOut : ( ofThisType ) ->
            outs = ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
            if not ofThisType? then return outs
            ( conn[0] for conn in outs when conn[1] is ofThisType )

Then we can do the same thing for incoming connections.

        allConnectionsIn : ( ofThisType ) ->
            ins = ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) ? [ ]
            if not ofThisType? then return ins
            ( conn[0] for conn in ins when conn[1] is ofThisType )

We can also request all connections between two given structures, which will
return a multiset of connection types, in the form of an array with possible
repeated entries.  Returns null if the argument is not a structure, or is
one without an ID.

        allConnectionsTo : ( otherStructure ) ->
            return null unless otherStructure instanceof Structure and \
                otherStructure.ID?
            outs = ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsOut' ) ? [ ]
            ( conn[1] for conn in outs when conn[0] is otherStructure.ID )

The final query treats all incoming connections to a structure as if they
give it "properties."  If A connects to B with type T, then when we look up
the key T in B's properties, we get an array that will contain A.  For
more information, see the documentation
[here](https://lurchmath.github.io/lde/site/phase0-structures/#connections).

        properties : ->
            result = { }
            for conn in ( @getExternalAttribute 'connectionsIn' ) ? [ ]
                if ( source = Structure.instanceWithID conn[0] )?
                    ( result[conn[1]] ?= [ ] ).push source
            result

## Accessibility

A structure A is accessible to a structure B if they have a common ancestor
and are positioned within that ancestor in such a way that B could cite A as
a premise.

The officially definition is that a structure is accessible to all of its
previous siblings, all the previous siblings of its parent, all the previous
siblings of its grandparent, and so on up the ancestor chain.  Note that a
structure is not accessible to itself, nor to any of its ancestors.
Conversely, if A is accessible to B, then we say that B is in the scope of
A.

### Foundational accessibility functions

We begin with two functions, implementing the accessibility/scope relations.

        isAccessibleTo : ( other ) ->
            if other not instanceof Structure then return no
            if not other.parent()? then return no
            if @parent() is other.parent()
                @indexInParent() < other.indexInParent()
            else
                @isAccessibleTo other.parent()
        isInTheScopeOf : ( other ) -> other.isAccessibleTo this

For all the other computations we will want to do with scopes and
accessibility, we will need iterators over all structures accessible to (or
in the scope of, respectively) this one.  An iterator for a set S is an
object `I` such that repeated calls to `I.next()` yield new elements of S
until S is exhausted, at which point all future calls to `I.next()` return
null.

The first iterator function lists all structures accessible to this one, in
reverse order in the hierarchy.  That is, all previous siblings are yielded
from right to left, then all previous siblings of the parent, and so on.

        iteratorOverAccessibles : ->
            ancestor : this
            sibling : this
            next : ->
                if not @ancestor? then return null
                if ( @sibling = @sibling.previousSibling() )?
                    return @sibling
                @sibling = @ancestor = @ancestor.parent()
                @next()

The second iterator function lists all structures in the scope of this one,
in forward order in the hierarchy.  That is, all descendants of the next
sibling are yielded, then all descendants of the subsequent sibling, and so
on, in the order of a postorder tree traversal.

        iteratorOverScope : ->
            chain : [ this ]
            next : ->
                if @chain.length is 0 then return null
                last = @chain.pop()
                if ( walk = last.nextSibling() )?
                    @chain.push walk
                    @chain.push walk while ( walk = walk.children()[0] )?
                    @chain[@chain.length-1]
                else if @chain.length > 0
                    @chain[@chain.length-1]
                else
                    null

### Accessibility convenience functions

We then create two functions that can use these iterators for searching or
enumeration.  Call `first(iterator,predicate)` to get the first element the
iterator yields satisfying the predicate.  Call `all(iterator,prediacte)`
with the obvious related meaning.  In each case, the predicate can be
omitted to get the first element or all elements (no restrictions).  If the
predicate is never satisfied, `first` returns undefiend, and `all` returns
an empty array.

        first = ( iterator, predicate = -> yes ) ->
            while ( next = iterator.next() )?
                if predicate next then return next
        all = ( iterator, predicate = -> yes ) ->
            result = [ ]
            while ( next = iterator.next() )?
                if predicate next then result.push next
            result

We can then write useful functions whose names give their obvious meanings,
by combining the tools above.

        firstAccessible : ( predicate = -> yes ) ->
            first @iteratorOverAccessibles(), predicate
        allAccessibles : ( predicate = -> yes ) ->
            all @iteratorOverAccessibles(), predicate
        firstInScope : ( predicate = -> yes ) ->
            first @iteratorOverScope(), predicate
        allInScope : ( predicate = -> yes ) ->
            all @iteratorOverScope(), predicate
