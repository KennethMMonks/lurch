 * well, but it may contain metavariables, as defined
 * {@link Constraint#metavariable here}.
 * 
 * Note that a Constraint need not be true or satisfiable.  Here are three
 * examples using ordinary mathematical notation.  For the purposes of these
 * examples, let us assume that capital letter symbols stand for metavariables,
 * and no other symbols are metavariables.
 * 
 *  * The constraint $(3-t,3-t)$ is clearly satisfiable, because its expression
 *    already exactly matches its pattern, with no metavariables even coming
 *    into play at all.
 *  * The constraint $(A+B,3x+y^2)$ is satisfiable, because we could instantiate
 *    the metavariables with $A\mapsto 3x,B\mapsto y^2$ to demonstrate that $e$
 *    is of the form expressed by $p$.
 *  * The constraint $(3,\forall x.P(x))$ is not satisfiable, because $p\neq e$
 *    and $p$ contains no metavariables that we might instantiate to change $p$.
 *  * The constraint $(A+B,\forall x.P(x))$ is not satisfiable, because no
 *    possible instantiations of the metavariables $A,B$ can make the summation
 *    in $p$ into the universal quantifier in $e$.
