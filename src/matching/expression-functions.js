/**
 * @file Defines functions for working with expression functions and their
 *   applications
 * 
 * Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the set of expressions in a language.  Here, we will
 * think of $\mathcal{L}$ as all possible {@link Expression Expressions}, in
 * the technical sense of that word (not just saying "expression" informally,
 * but now referring to instances of the {@link Expression Expressions} class).
 * 
 * An *Expression Function* (or EF for short) is a function whose signature is
 * $f:\mathcal{L}^n\to\mathcal{L}$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$.  We need a way to
 * represent Expression Functions as {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}.
 * This module provides functions that let us do so.
 * 
 * We will write an Expression Function using standard $\lambda$ notation, as in
 * $\lambda v_1,\ldots,v_n.B$, where each $v_i$ is a parameter to the function
 * (represented using a {@link Symbol Symbol} with the name `v_1`, `v_2`, etc.))
 * and the body $B$ is any {@link Expression Expression} that may contain free
 * instances of the $v_i$ that can be replaced with other
 * {@link Expression Expressions} when the function is applied to arguments.
 * For example, if $f=\lambda v_1,v_2.v_1+\cos(v_2+1)$, then we could apply $f$
 * to the {@link Expression Expressions} $3$ and $k$ to obtain the new
 * {@link Expression Expression} $3+\cos(k+1)$.
 * 
 * The above paragraph uses ordinary mathematical notation, but we will need to
 * be able to write expression functions in
 * {@link LogicConcept.fromPutdown putdown} notation so that we can express
 * them as {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}.  We define a constant in this
 * module to be `"LDE lambda"` so that we can express the $f$ from above as
 * `("LDE lambda" v_1 v_2 , (+ v_1 (cos (+ v_2 1))))`.
 * That constant may change in later versions of the LDE, so clients should not
 * hard-code that name into their code, but instead use
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.newEF newEF()} and
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.isAnEF isAnEF()}.
 * 
 * You can also check the number of arguments of an expression function with
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.arityOfEF arityOfEF()} and apply them with
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.applyEF applyEF()}.  And you can create
 * simple types of expression functions with
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.constantEF constantEF()} and
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.projectionEF projectionEF()}.
 * 
 * An *Expression Function Application* (or EFA for short) is an
 * {@link Expression Expression} expressing the idea that we are applying some
 * Expression Function to a list of arguments.  For example, the application
 * above was $f(3,k)$, but we cannot write this in
 * {@link LogicConcept#fromPutdown putdown notation} as `(f 3 k)` because that
 * would be indistinguishable from normal function application.  Thus we need a
 * new symbol.  We define a constant in this module to be `"LDE EFA"` so that we
 * can express $f(3,k)$ as `("LDE EFA" f 3 k)`.  That constant may change in
 * later versions of the LDE, so clients should not hard-code that name into
 * their code, but instead use {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.newEF newEFA()}
 * and {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.isAnEF isAnEFA()}.  You can also check
 * whether an EFA is evaluatable with
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.canBetaReduce canBetaReduce()} and evaluate
 * it (or any possible $\beta$-reduction inside it) with
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.betaReduce betaReduce()} and
 * {@link module:ExpressionFunctions.fullBetaReduce fullBetaReduce()}.
