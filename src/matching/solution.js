     *     {@link Expression Expression}.  This fails because a
     *     {@link Substitution Substitution} is a function, and so it cannot
     *     map the same input to more than one output.
     *  2. If the {@link Substitution Substitution} maps a metavariable to a
     *     non-{@link Symbol Symbol}, and yet the metavariable appears as the
     *     bound variable in a quantifier.  This fails because quantifiers can
     *     bind only variables, so we cannot replace a bound metavariable with
     *     anything but another variable.
     *  3. If applying the given {@link Substitution Substitution} violates
     *     any one of the {@link CaptureConstraints CaptureConstraints} stored
     *     in this Solution.  This fails because if we later apply the
     *     Solution to the original {@link Problem Problem} from which it was
