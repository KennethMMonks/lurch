/**
 * A capture constraint is a pair of variables $(b,f)$, where the former appears
 * as a bound variable (hence the name $b$) and in its scope, the latter appears
 * free (hence the name $f$).  It is called a capture constraint because the
 * variable $f$ cannot be replaced by any expression containing $b$ free, or
 * variable capture would occur.  (The reader may recall that the standard
 * definition of variable capture is that a variable that appears free in an
 * expression becomes bound when that expression is placed in a new context,
 * typically through substitution.)
 * 
 * This class will store the $b$ and $f$ internally, but note that either of
 * them might be a metavariable.  Such metavariables are interpreted as meaning
 * "we do not yet know the value of this variable, but it will be determined
 * later, and replaced here when we determine it."  Consequently, we might have
 * a capture constraint whose meaning is still uncertain, until the
 * metavariables in it have been instantiated.  See the
 * {@link CaptureConstraint#complete complete()} function below for more
 * details.
