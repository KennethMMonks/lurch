This document\ncan be used as reference, and to guide development, but it may also be\nchanged as better ideas come along.\n\n\nTo see the specific phases of development planned for the LDE, and what's\ncompleted, use the \"Phases\" menu above.\n\n\nElegance and Simplicity\n\n\nThese are of utmost importance, because\n\n\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to explain to students or in an Advanced User's\n   Guide (AUG),\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to test because it has fewer unusual corner cases\n   or special handling of odd circumstances,\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to implement for the same reason, and\n\n\nthey make it easier for us to be confident that our designs are good,\n   because they're easier to hold in your head and grok all at once.\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and Validation\n\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Lurch application is to give feedback to the\n   user about the work they type into their document.\n\n\nBecause this will often involve validating steps of work in a proof, we\n   may use the terms \"feedback\" and \"validation\" interchangeably, even\n   though technically validation is just a particular type of feedback\n   (though the most common type in our case).\n\n\nOne-Pass Validation (OPV)\n is a paradigm in which, whenever the app\n   needs to update feedback in response to changes made by the user, it\n   does so by reprocessing every bit of meaningful content from scratch, in\n   one (large, possibly time-consuming) pass over the whole document.\n\n\nReal-Time Validation (RTV)\n is a paradigm in which, whenever the app\n   needs to update feedback in response to changes made by the user, it\n   attempts to re-use as much information from previous validation as\n   possible, only updating those portions of it that need updating in\n   response to the specific change the user just made.  Thus RTV is\n   trickier to design and implement than OPV, but more efficient at\n   run-time.\n\n\nAn important concept for our test suite is that any RTV design can be\n   converted to an OPV design trivially, and then used for comparison\n   testing.  Simply replace all sophisticated RTV-style change event\n   handlers with OPV-style ones, that mark the entire document as needing\n   reprocessing.  Then any potential change that can be made to the user's\n   document can be run through each of these engines in parallel, and the\n   results compared for equivalence.\n\n\nNote that the choice of OPV vs. RTV is independent of the choice of\n   manual validation vs. automatic validation.  RTV certainly makes\n   automatic validation nicer, and thus makes manual validation less\n   appealing, but you could choose anything from among\n   \n\\{\\text{OPV},\\text{RTV}\\}\\times\\{\\text{auto},\\text{manual}\\}\n.\n\n\n\n\nLDE and UI\n\n\n\n\nWe have a paradigm in which the UI is exactly that (user interface) and\n   the LDE (Lurch Deductive Engine) is the brain that operates in one or\n   more background threads, processing what the user has given the app\n   through the UI.\n\n\nWe aim to implement every feature in the LDE if possible, but implement\n   in the UI only those features that can't be implemented in the LDE.\n   Here, \"if possible\" means that it would not break the model-view\n   paradigm to implement it in the LDE (i.e., the LDE wouldn't need to\n   speak HTML).  Reasons for this:\n\n\nThe LDE will be implemented in pure JS, no DOM, so that it can be\n  used in a WebWorker and in the unit testing suite.\n\n\nTherefore the bigger the LDE is, the more of our code has been\n  subject to rigorous unit tests.\n\n\nAnd the bigger the LDE is, the more of our code is run out of the UX\n  thread, and thus the more responsive our app is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decisions recorded here are almost entirely about the design of the\n   LDE, not the UI.\n\n\n\n\nStructures\n\n\n\n\nDefine a \nstructure\n to be the basic unit of meaning in the LDE.\n\n\nThis includes document-level structures such as a section,\n  subsection, proof, subproof, etc., which are analogous to block-level\n  items like DIV or P in HTML, and \n\\begin{X}...\\end{X}\n in LaTeX.\n\n\nBut it also includes inline structures (SPANs in HTML, \n\\foo{...}\n or\n  \n$...$\n in LaTeX).\n\n\nStructures can be nested acyclically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of types of structures that we may choose to define later:\n\n\nProofs/Subproofs, with one specific flavor of it being the kind that\n  declares a variable first\n\n\nDefinitions of rules, axioms, language rules\n\n\nFormal systems (or \"mathematical topics\")\n\n\nTheorems and pairing of them with proofs\n\n\nExpressions\n\n\nMaybe variables will be declared by based on placing a variable\n  inside an expression by itself, at the head of a variable declaration\n  subproof, or maybe by creating a new structure type for variable\n  declarations, or maybe something else\n\n\nHomework problems\n\n\nExamples (an environment in which anything you declare ends its scope\n  at the end of the example, no matter what it was)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of structure types should equal the set of common mathematical\n   structures that mathematics students should be learning anyway, and they\n   should behave the same in Lurch as in mathematics.  This ensures that\n   Lurch doesn't add to the mathematics learning curve in this sense.\n\n\nNot every structure is permitted to contain every other type of\n   structure.  But such rules are enforced through validation, which we\n   will not be defining for some time yet, so this comment is just a\n   preview of what's to come.  For instance, expressions can contain only\n   other expressions.\n\n\nAt some later point, we may care about the meanings of structures, so\n   that they can be used as premises in proofs.  At such a time, we will\n   ensure that a structure's meaning includes the unjustified steps in the\n   structure (which function as premises), the final step in the structure\n   (which functions as its conclusion), any variables declared within it\n   (which are bound in it), and so on, but it is not necessary to define\n   those details yet.  I mention them here merely so that the idea is not\n   lost.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nA structure A is accessible to a structure B if some ancestor structure\n   of B (possibly B itself) is a sibling of A, but A is the (strictly)\n   earlier of the two siblings within their parent structure.\n\n\nEquivalently, we can speak of \"scope\" rather than accessibility.  The\n   scope of a structure A is all later siblings of A in the same parent,\n   along with all their descendants.  Thus B is in the scope of A iff A is\n   accessible to B.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\nEvery structure contains a key-value dictionary called \nexternal\n   attributes,\n which are read-only from the point of view of the LDE, and\n   are read-write from the point of view of the UI.  They are called\n   \"external\" because, from the LDE's point of view, they come from\n   elsewhere (the UI).\n\n\nEvery structure contains a key-value dictionary called \ncomputed\n   attributes,\n which are read-only from the point of view of the UI, and\n   are read-write from the point of view of the LDE.  They are called\n   \"computed\" because the LDE's job is to compute stuff, which it stores in\n   these attributes.\n\n\nThese two dictionaries are disjoint.  It is possible for a single key k\n   to have one value in the one dictionary, and another value in the other\n   dictionary.\n\n\n\n\nDocument\n\n\n\n\nThe entire document will be represented to the LDE as a single\n   structure, usually with a nonzero number of inner structures.\n\n\nWe call the representation of the entire document as a structure the LDE\n   Document, a phrase chosen to connote \"the LDE's view of the document,\n   not the one the user sees in the UI.\"\n\n\nOne main job of the UI is to convert from what the user sees into the\n   LDE Document.\n\n\nSo to the list of structure types above, add \"Document.\"\n\n\nThe entire LDE Document data structure will live inside the LDE module.\n   In the main Lurch app, this implies that the LDE Document will be stored\n   in the background thread where the LDE runs, not in the UI.  Thus the UI\n   will communicate across threads to create the LDE Document.  Details on\n   this later.\n\n\n\n\nSome brief UI comments\n\n\n\n\nMost of the purpose of the UI will be to convert the HTML document the\n   user sees into the LDE Document the LDE processes, then to show the user\n   in the HTML document and feedback the LDE sends back.\n\n\nIn service to that purpose, the UI contains many (largely independent\n  and usually small) features for encoding the HTML document into the\n  LDE Document.\n\n\nExamples include conventions for processing groups, connections,\n  numbered lists, section headings, finding meaning in text through\n  regular expressions, and the meanings of various LaTeX-like\n  \n\\shortcuts\n.\n\n\nA document author chooses which subset of these features to enable by\n  making choices in the document settings dialog.  Those settings are\n  stored in document metadata, and propagate to dependencies (defined\n  below).\n\n\nThe UI will have very little hard-coded (i.e., non-customizable)\n  procedures for interpreting the HTML document into the LDE document;\n  the settings above are highly choosable by the user.\n\n\nThe only constrained interpretation conventions (i.e., few or no\n  options for changing the interpretation) would be those that have\n  mathematical names, such as \"proof,\" which have a specific meaning\n  that it would be educationally counterproductive to interpret another\n  way.\n\n\nIn addition, we may choose a specific set of document settings to use\n  throughout the standard libraries that ship with Lurch, to show best\n  practices and help users with consistency and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther UI details:\n\n\nBecause we have a UI that allows users to make connections among\n  groups, the structures in the hierarchy may include, among their\n  external attributes, a binary, edge-labeled multigraph.  (Note that\n  this does not require that every connection in the HTML document\n  become two Structures in the LDE Document with attributes connecting\n  them.  Nor does it stipulate that some concept--such as\n  labeling--that we might decide to represent as part of this\n  multigraph can't also be represented sometimes in another way as\n  well.)\n\n\nIf we require the LDE to send a signal when validation completes,\n  then we can make a UI setting of whether to show feedback as the\n  feedback arrives, or only after the \"all validation complete\" signal\n  arrives (and thus feedback has stabilized).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructures are OOP Objects\n\n\n\n\nA structure exposes a set of data and methods about its internal state\n   to the rest of the app, in much the same way as Objects in OOP do, with\n   the type of structure (from the list above, e.g., Theorem or Example)\n   functioning as the \"class\" of the Object.\n\n\nSome methods in a structure will be time-intensive to run, and thus\n   should use an asynchronous paradigm, queueing the tasks for running when\n   the LDE thread has time.  The most time-intensive tasks, such as\n   matching and parsing, may be delegated to yet other background threads\n   by the LDE thread.\n\n\n\n\nExporting data from structures\n\n\n\n\nHere is an important example method that all structures should have\n   (though each class may implement it differently):\n\n\nA method that reports which structures (usually child structures of\n  A), if any, are to be made accessible to any structure B in the scope\n  of A (thus changing the normal scoping rules).\n\n\nThe flexibility inherent in the vagueness of this exporting notion is\n  useful.  For instance, a single theorem in the document might be\n  encoded in the LDE document as having many children, some of which\n  are its various interpretations as a rule of inference, and export\n  them all, so that any can be used/cited later.\n\n\nNote that the exports method need not copy child structures directly\n  for exporting.  It may combine/manipulate/compute structures to\n  export based on its children in any way.  Thus \"scope\" is a simple\n  and clean definition, which this function sort of indirectly extends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will define much of the functionality of the LDE as the various\n   structures in the document calling methods in one another, which is\n   simple and elegant.  But it requires that we carefully track and cache\n   the clean/dirty status of each structure, to retain efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nDependencies as a special case\n\n\n\n\nThe current paradigm (already implemented) in webLurch is that a\n   dependency must specify what data it exports to any document that\n   depends on it.\n\n\nSuch data will be stored in the dependency document's metadata, so that\n   documents depending on it can easily import it.  It will include\n   anything that the dependency imported from its dependencies, and so on\n   to arbitrary depth.\n\n\nBecause we now require every structure to know what it exports to later\n   structures, the question of what a document exports is simply a special\n   case of that.  The document is itself a structure, and thus it can\n   already answer the \"what does this document export?\" question.\n\n\nRecall from above that one of the pieces of data that a document will\n   export is its document settings, as described earlier.\n\n\n\n\nDesign Phases\n\n\n\n\nThe question, \"Which structure should be designed first?\" is tricky\n   because each structure is rather complex, and they're rather\n   interdependent.\n\n\nOne approach would be to design each structure incrementally, adding\n   features in phases.\n\n\nThus we might begin with an LDE implementation that has just a few\n   features for a few structure types, and yet is sufficient for building\n   very simply Lurch libraries.\n\n\nThis lets us build familiarity and knowledge as we do the design, so\n   we're better at it by the time we get to the hard stuff.\n\n\nPhases 2, 3, and so on can add features and structure types, thus\n   enabling more and more sophisticated Lurch libraries, until we have\n   reached the level of power that supports a first proof course.\n\n\n\n\nSee other documentation on this site for the contents of each design phase.",

The flexibility inherent in the vagueness of this exporting notion is\n  useful.  For instance, a single theorem in the document might be\n  encoded in the LDE document as having many children, some of which\n  are its various interpretations as a rule of inference, and export\n  them all, so that any can be used/cited later.  Note that the exports method need not copy child structures directly\n  for exporting.  It may combine/manipulate/compute structures to\n  export based on its children in any way.  Thus \"scope\" is a simple\n  and clean definition, which this function sort of indirectly extends.    We will define much of the functionality of the LDE as the various\n   structures in the document calling methods in one another, which is\n   simple and elegant.  But it requires that we carefully track and cache\n   the clean/dirty status of each structure, to retain efficiency.",

It will include\n   anything that the dependency imported from its dependencies, and so on\n   to arbitrary depth.  Because we now require every structure to know what it exports to later\n   structures, the question of what a document exports is simply a special\n   case of that.  The document is itself a structure, and thus it can\n   already answer the \"what does this document export?\" question.

Once it has been implemented, its\ncontents will be documented in the API Documentation available from the\nnavigation menu at the top of this site.\n\n\nApp launch\n\n\nWhen the Client is loaded into memory (say, at app launch) it will create a\nglobal structure that is intended to be a sort of shallow/shadow/fake copy\nof the LDE Document.\n\n\n\n\nBecause it will imitate the structure of the LDE Document, it will be\n   a hierarchy.\n\n\nBut it will not be a hierarchy of Structures, because as we know,\n   Structures do computation, and that's the job of the LDE.  This is\n   just a front-end; it doesn't do anything.\n\n\nSo rather than calling each node in the Client's hierarchy a\n   Structure, I'll call it a \nFacade.\n  This is to emphasize that this\n   hierarchy, stored in the Client (part of the UI) can't do anything at\n   all.  It's picture of what's really going on elsewhere, in the LDE.\n\n\n\n\nBackground threads\n\n\nThe Client can be told about the existence of a background thread that's\nrunning the LDE.\n\n\n\n\nIf it is told about such a thread, then any later\n   insertions/deletions/changes to the Facade hierarchy will immediately\n   be communicated by the Client to that LDE thread as a change event\n   (defined above).\n\n\nThis guarantees that the Facade hierarchy and LDE Document are always\n   in sync:  Because the LDE never alters its hierarchy, messages need\n   propagate in only one direction to guarantee that the two hierarchies\n   are isomorphic.\n\n\n\n\nNo subclasses\n\n\nBecause the nodes in the Facade don't actually do anything, they have no\nsubclasses.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the Structure class, which it makes sense to subclass so that\n   we can add various features like validation functions and so forth,\n   none of that matters in the Facade.

In the main Lurch\napplication, it will represent the meaningful content that has been\nextracted from the user's document.\n\n\nManipulating the Document\n\n\nThe document can be manipulated with four functions in the public API of\nthis module:\n\n\n\n\ninsert(structureToInsert,parentID,insertionIndex)\n inserts a new\n   structure within the global document hierarchy, as follows:\n\n\nstructureToInsert\n should be the serialized form of the structure to\n  insert (optionally created with \n.toJSON()\n in a \nStructure\n\n  instance).  After the structure is deserialized and inserted into the\n  document, \ntrackIDs()\n will be called in it; for more information on\n  that function, see \nits entry in the API docs\n.\n\n\nparentID\n is the ID of the parent under which this new child should\n  be inserted.  This must be a string ID that belongs to a structure\n  already in the global document hierarchy.  Note that the root of the\n  hierarchy is given the ID \"root\" at the time the module is loaded.\n\n\ninsertionIndex\n is the index of the child to insert, which must be\n  greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the number of\n  children of the parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndelete(ID)\n deletes from the global document hierarchy the structure\n   with the given ID, which is interpreted with the same conventions as the\n   \nparentID\n is for the \ninsert\n function.  After the structure is deleted,\n   \nuntrackIDs()\n will be called in it; for more information on that\n   function, see \nits entry in the API docs\n.\n\n\nreplace(ID,newStructure)\n replaces the structure with the given ID with\n   the given new structure.\n\n\nID\n is interpreted with the same conventions as the \nparentID\n is for\n  the \ninsert\n function\n\n\nnewStructure\n is a serialized structure, as \nstructureToInsert\n is\n  for the \ninsert\n function\n\n\nAfter this operation, \nuntrackIDs()\n will be called in the replaced\n  structure and \ntrackIDs()\n in the replacement; for more information\n  on those functions, see\n  \ntheir entries in the API docs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetAttribute(ID,key,value)\n modifies a single external attribute of a\n   structure within the global document hierarchy, as follows:\n\n\nID\n is interpreted with the same conventions as the \nparentID\n is for\n  the \ninsert\n function\n\n\nkey\n is the key of the external attribute to create or overwrite.  If\n  this key happens to be \"id\", then the class-level tracking of IDs\n  will be updated to repsect the change.\n\n\nvalue\n is the new value, which must be JSON data.  (No checks are\n  done to verify that it is JSON data, but errors will transpire\n  eventually if non-JSON data is passed.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsynchronous API\n\n\nIf the LDE detects that it is being run in a background thread, it will set\nup listeners for messages from the parent thread.  These listeners will\nhandle messages of four types, \ninsert\n/\ndelete\n/\nreplace\n/\nsetAttribute\n,\nmirroring the four functions given above, and calling them internally.\n\n\nThey can be called by passing a message of the form \n[ command, args... ]\n,\nwhere the command is a string (one of \n\"insert\"\n, \n\"delete\"\n, etc.) and the\narguments list is the same list that would be passed to the function itself,\nas documented in the previous section on this page.\n\n\nFor example, you could start an LDE in a WebWorker and insert a new\nstructure as the first child of its global document as follows.\n\n\n    // import the lde.js file (kept in the release/ folder)\n    // (This requires having the structure.js file in the same folder.)\n    var worker = new Worker( 'lde.js' );\n    var A = new Structure();\n    worker.postMessage( [ 'insert', A.toJSON(), 'root', 0 ] );",

The nodes\nin that tree are instances of this class (\nStructure\n) or one of its\nsubclasses.\n\n\nWe build into this base class all the functionality that must be present at\nevery point in that hierarchy, and leave to subclasses that functionality\nthat makes sense only for specific types of structures.  For instance, this\nclass contains no functionality to support rules of inference, because they\nare one specific type of structure, so their functionality will be\nimplemented in a subclass for that purpose.\n\n\nConstructing and Serialization\n\n\nThere is one constructor for the class\n(\nsee source code\n):\n\n\nStructure(child1,child2,...)\n creates a new instance, with the given list\nof children, each of which must be a \nStructure\n instance (or it will be\nignored).  All such children are removed from any old parent they had before\nbeing inserted into this newly created one.\n\n\nInstances can be converted to and from JSON, for saving to a file, storing\npermanently anywhere, or transmitting across threads or network connections.\nTo ensure that deserialization correctly reconstructs instances of the right\nsubclass of \nStructure\n, each subclass must be registered.  To do so, we\nprovide the \naddSubclass\n function.  Use it like so.\n\n\nJavaScript:\n\n\n    MySubclass = function ( /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ };\n    // ...\n    MySubclass.prototype.className = Structure.addSubclass( 'MySubclass', MySubclass );\n\n\n\n\nCoffeeScript, somewhere inside the class definition:\n\n\n    class MySubclass extends Structure\n        # ...\n        className : Structure.addSubclass 'MySubclass', MySubclass\n        # ...\n\n\n\n\nThen one can serialize and deserialize any hierarchy containing \nStructure\n\ninstances, as well as instances of its subclasses, using the member function\n\nsomeInstance.toJSON()\n (which obviously yields a JSON structure) or the\nclass function \nStructure.fromJSON(data)\n, which accepts JSON data created\nfrom the first function.\n\n\nSerializing a structure preserves its class, its external and computed\nattributes (\ndocumented below\n), and\nthe hierarchy for which it is the root.\n\n\nStructure hierarchies\n\n\nTo navigate or alter a hierarchy of \nStructure\n instances, use the\nfollowing member functions present in each instance.\n\n\n\n\ninstance.parent()\n yields the parent structure, or \nnull\n if there is\n   no parent (i.e., the instance is the root of a hierarchy)\n\n\ninstance.children()\n yields an array containing the children structures,\n   in order, or an empty array if there are none\n\n\ninstance.indexInParent()\n yields the index of the child in its parent's\n   ordered list of children, or unddefined if the instance has no parent\n\n\ninstance.previousSibling()\n and \ninstance.nextSibling()\n yield the\n   adjacent structure in the parent's child list, forward or backward, as\n   expected, or undefined if there is no such sibling\n\n\ninstance.removeFromParent()\n drops the instance from it's parent's list\n   of children (thereby decreasing the length of that child list by 1) and\n   thus making \ninstance.parent()\n null\n\n\ninstance.removeChild(index)\n is a convenience equivalent to\n   \ninstance.children()[index].removeFromParent()\n\n\ninstance.insertChild(child,index)\n expects a structure instance as the\n   first argument and an index into the children list as the second.  It\n   inserts the new child at that index, thus increasing the number of\n   children by 1.  You may use an index equal to the length of the child\n   list to append.  The child is removed from its previous parent, if any,\n   before being inserted here.\n\n\ninstance.replaceWith(other)\n expects another structure instance as its\n   argument.  It removes \ninstance\n from its parent, if there is one, and\n   then inserts \nother\n at the same index in the parent, thus replacing\n   \ninstance\n.  This has no effect if \ninstance\n has no parent.  It is\n   equivalent to successive calls to \nremoveFromParent()\n and\n   \ninsertChild()\n at the instance and its parent, respectively.\n\n\ninstance.copy()\n makes a deep copy of the instance, including all nodes\n   below it in the hierarchy.  This new copy will have all the same IDs as\n   the previous copy, so to preserve uniqueness of IDs, you will usually\n   want to call \ncopiedInstance.clearIDs()\n afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nThe order of nodes in the hierarchy is often important.  We have one simple\norder relation on the nodes in the hierarchy, and one more complex.  The\nsimplest is just whether node A is \"earlier than\" node B, in the order\ninduced by an in-order tree traversal (that is, the order in which the open\nparentheses would appear if the tree were written as a LISP expression).\nThis relation can be tested with \ninstance.isEarlierThan(other)\n.\n\n\nThe more complex order relation is accessibility, which we do not define\nhere, because it is already defined \nin the source code\ndocumentation\n.\nThat relation is implemented with the following member functions available\nin all instances of the class.\n\n\n\n\nA.isAccessibleTo(B)\n implements the relation as defined at the link\n   given above.\n\n\nA.isInTheScopeOf(B)\n is equivalent to \nB.isAccessibleTo(A)\n.\n\n\nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n yields an \"iterator\" object, which is an\n   object that can produce the list of nodes accessible to \nA\n by repeated\n   calls to the \nnext()\n member of the object.  Consider the following\n   JavaScript code that would use such an iterator.\n\n\n\n\n    var iterator = A.iteratorOverAccessibles();\n    var accessible;\n    while ( accessible = iterator.next() ) {\n        console.log( 'The next accessible structure is:',\n            accessible.toJSON() );\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNodes are produced by the iterator in reverse order (under the\n\nisEarlierThan\n relation) starting from the first accessible node before\n\nA\n.  When the \nnext()\n function yields null for the first time, the end of\nthe list has been reached.  (The \nnext()\n function will yield null forever\nthereafter.)\n\n\nIterators are more efficient than producing the entire list and returning\nit, because the client may be seeking just one particular node in the list,\nand thus producing the entire list so that the client can search just a\nsmall part of it could be wasteful.\n\n\nThere is an analogous function for scopes.\n\n\n\n\nA.iteratorOverScope()\n functions like \nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n, but\n   walks forwards through the structure, including precisely those nodes for\n   which \nB.isInTheScopeOf(A)\n holds true.\n\n\n\n\nThere are then four functions that use these iterators under the hood.\nClients will most likely wish to use these rather than have direct access\nto the iterators.\n\n\n\n\nA.firstAccessible(P)\n expects \nP\n to be a one-place predicate (that is,\n   a JavaScript function that can be evaluated on a single argument, and\n   yields true or false in each case) and yields the first item on the\n   \"accessibles\" list (as given by \nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n) for which\n   \nP\n yields true.  It returns undefined if there is no such thing.\n\n\nA.firstInScope(P)\n expects \nP\n to be a one-place predicate, as just\n   defined, and behaves just like \nfirstAccessible()\n, except it walks\n   through \nA.iteratorOverScope()\n instead.\n\n\nA.allAccessibles(P)\n expects \nP\n as in the previous two functions, and\n   yields all nodes accessible to \nA\n that satisfy \nP\n, in the same order\n   they would be reported by \niteratorOverAccessibles()\n.\n\n\nA.allInScope(P)\n expects \nP\n as in the previous two functions, and\n   yields all nodes in the scope of \nA\n that satisfy \nP\n, in the same order\n   they would be reported by \niteratorOverScope()\n.\n\n\n\n\nStructure attributes and connections\n\n\nAttributes in general\n\n\nStructures have two types of attributes, computed and external.  The\ndistinction is documented in the source code,\n\nhere\n and\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nThe following functions available in each instance of the structure class\nsupport external and computed attributes.\n\n\n\n\ninstance.getComputedAttribute(key)\n and\n   \ninstance.getExternalAttribute(key)\n look up computed or external\n   attributes by a given string \nkey\n.\n\n\ninstance.setComputedAttribute(key,value)\n and\n   \ninstance.setExternalAttribute(key,value)\n store computed or external\n   attributes under a given string \nkey\n with value \nvalue\n, which should be\n   a JSON structure (or atomic data).  No check is made to verify that the\n   value is of this type, but errors will transpire later if this condition\n   is not satisfied (specifically, serialization errors).\n\n\ninstance.clearComputedAttributes(key1,key2,...)\n and\n   \ninstance.clearExternalAttributes(key1,key2,...)\n remove the key-value\n   pairs of computed or external attributes associated with any of the keys\n   passed as parameters.  It is acceptable to pass any number of keys,\n   including just one.  If zero are passed, \nall\n key-value pairs are\n   removed.\n\n\ninstance.attr(object)\n adds all attributes of the given object as\n   external attributes to the instance, and returns the instance itself.\n   This is useful when constructing hierarchies, as follows.\n\n\n\n\n    var A = new Structure(\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { name : 'example structure' } ),\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { color : '#99ff00' } )\n    );\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstance.compute(arguments)\n is a useful shortcut for storing computed\n   attributes.  We do not redocument its details here; see the documentation\n   in the source code at the end of\n   \nthis section\n.\n\n\n\n\nConnections as a type of attribute\n\n\nWithin a structure's external attributes are two key-value pairs that should\nnot be used for any other purpose, those with keys \nconnectionsOut\n and\n\nconnectionsIn\n.  These store data about connections between pairs of\nstructures in the same heirarchy.  The data is stored by structure IDs, so\nmaking connections assumes that structures each have a unique ID, as\ndocumented \nbelow\n.\n\n\nYou can query the connections among structures with these functions:\n\n\n\n\nsource.allConnectionsOut(type)\n returns a list of all destinations to\n   which the source is connected by one or more connections of the given\n   type.  Each destination appears on the list a number of times equal to\n   the number of connections of the given type from the source to that\n   destination.\n\n\ndestination.allConnectionsIn(type)\n functions analogously to the\n   previous, but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a\n   source.\n\n\nsource.allConnectionsOut()\n returns a list of destination-type pairs,\n   all connections that go out from the given source structure.\n\n\ndestination.allConnectionsIn()\n functions analogously to the previous,\n   but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a source.\n\n\n\n\nTo create or destroy connections, use these functions:\n\n\n\n\nsource.connectTo(destination,type)\n, where \nsource\n and \ndestination\n\n   are \nStructure\n instances and \ntype\n is a string containing the type of\n   connection, creates a new connection.  There can be multiple connections\n   between the same two structures, even of the same type.  Returns true if\n   the connection was formed, false if some error prevented it (such as the\n   destination not being a structure, or not having an ID, or the source\n   not having an ID).\n\n\nsource.disconnectFrom(destination,type)\n undoes the previous operation.\n   Because there may be multiple connections between the source and\n   destination of the same type, this simply decreases that number by one.\n   Returns true on success or false on failure (for example, if there were\n   no connection to delete).\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nconnectionsOut\n and \nconnectionsIn\n data is directly manipulated by\nthe client (not recommended), then you can call \nroot.fillOutConnections()\n\nto ensure that the connection data stored in every source matches that\nstored in the corresponding destinations, and vice versa.\n\n\nOther attribute conventions\n\n\nID:\n  Some structures have a unique ID.  This is necessary for making\nconnections among structures, because the connections are recorded using\nthese unique IDs as references.  The convention is to store a structure's ID\nin its external attribute with key \"id.\"  For convenience, there is an\n\nid()\n member function in the structure class that looks up this\nattribute's value.  See more information in the\n\nUnique IDs section\n, below.\n\n\nText:\n  Some structures contain plain text.  The convention is to store\nthese in the external attribute with key \"text.\"  For convenience, there is\na \ntext()\n member function in the structure class that looks up this\nattribute's value.\n\n\nReferences:\n  Some structures serve as references to other structures. They\nare marked as references with the external attribute \"reference.\"  For\nconvenience, there is a \nisA()\n member function in the structure class that\ncan look up whether this attribute is present, by calling\n\nisA('reference')\n, and thus indicating whether the structure is\nfunctioning as a reference.\n\n\nLabels:\n  Get a list of all text values used as labels for a structure by\ncalling its member function \nlabels()\n.  There are several ways that a\nstructure can be labeled, all documented\n\nin the source code\n.  All labels are strings.\n\n\nCheck whether a string is on that list with the member function\n\nhasLabel(label)\n.\n\n\nReasons and premises:\n  You can get a list of all reasons or premises\nattached to a structure with the member functions \nreasons()\n and\n\npremises()\n.  These may be structures or the names by which structures\naccessible to this one are labeled.  There are several ways that a structure\ncan have a reason or premise attached, all documented\n\nin the source code\n.\n\n\nCitations:\n  Given a string and a structure \nS\n, you can look up the\nnearest accessible (to \nS\n) structure that has that string as a label with\n\nS.lookup(label)\n.  We say that one structure cites another if it has that\nother as a reason or premise; you can query this binary relation with\n\nstructure.cites(other)\n, and get a list of everything that cites a given\nstructure with \nstructure.whatCitesMe()\n.\n\n\nUnique IDs\n\n\nThe \nStructure\n class maintains a mapping from IDs (as strings) to\ninstances of the class.  An instance gets its ID from the external attribute\nwith key \"id.\"  All IDs in a hierarchy can be tracked (that is, recorded\ninto this class-level mapping) with the \ntrackIDs()\n function documented\nbelow.\n\n\nHere are the relevant functions:\n\n\n\n\ninstance.id()\n returns the instance's ID, if it has one, or undefined if\n   not\n\n\ninstance.trackIDs()\n asks the class to update the class variable that\n   maps IDs to instances, recording the connection of all IDs for all nodes\n   in the hierarchy whose root is \ninstance\n.  This will overwrite earlier\n   data in that mapping if and only if you have not kept IDs unique.\n\n\ninstance.untrackIDs()\n removes from the class-level mapping all IDs that\n   appear in the hierarchy whose root is \ninstance\n.  If you are done with\n   a \nStructure\n instance, you must call this function in it, so that its\n   memory is guaranteed to eventually be garbage collected.\n\n\nStructure.instanceWithID(id)\n takes a string ID and yields the instance\n   with that ID, if there is one, and that instance has recorded its ID in\n   the class-level variable for this purpose by means of a call to\n   \ntrackIDs()\n, or null or undefined if there is none.",

This new copy will have all the same IDs as\n   the previous copy, so to preserve uniqueness of IDs, you will usually\n   want to call  copiedInstance.clearIDs()  afterwards.   The order of nodes in the hierarchy is often important.  We have one simple\norder relation on the nodes in the hierarchy, and one more complex.  The\nsimplest is just whether node A is \"earlier than\" node B, in the order\ninduced by an in-order tree traversal (that is, the order in which the open\nparentheses would appear if the tree were written as a LISP expression).\nThis relation can be tested with  instance.isEarlierThan(other) .  The more complex order relation is accessibility, which we do not define\nhere, because it is already defined  in the source code\ndocumentation .\nThat relation is implemented with the following member functions available\nin all instances of the class.   A.isAccessibleTo(B)  implements the relation as defined at the link\n   given above.  A.isInTheScopeOf(B)  is equivalent to  B.isAccessibleTo(A) .  A.iteratorOverAccessibles()  yields an \"iterator\" object, which is an\n   object that can produce the list of nodes accessible to  A  by repeated\n   calls to the  next()  member of the object.  Consider the following\n   JavaScript code that would use such an iterator.       var iterator = A.iteratorOverAccessibles();\n    var accessible;\n    while ( accessible = iterator.next() ) {\n        console.log( 'The next accessible structure is:',\n            accessible.toJSON() );\n    }  Nodes are produced by the iterator in reverse order (under the isEarlierThan  relation) starting from the first accessible node before A .

Iterators are more efficient than producing the entire list and returning\nit, because the client may be seeking just one particular node in the list,\nand thus producing the entire list so that the client can search just a\nsmall part of it could be wasteful.  There is an analogous function for scopes.   A.iteratorOverScope()  functions like  A.iteratorOverAccessibles() , but\n   walks forwards through the structure, including precisely those nodes for\n   which  B.isInTheScopeOf(A)  holds true.   There are then four functions that use these iterators under the hood.\nClients will most likely wish to use these rather than have direct access\nto the iterators.   A.firstAccessible(P)  expects  P  to be a one-place predicate (that is,\n   a JavaScript function that can be evaluated on a single argument, and\n   yields true or false in each case) and yields the first item on the\n   \"accessibles\" list (as given by  A.iteratorOverAccessibles() ) for which\n    P  yields true.

The following functions available in each instance of the structure class\nsupport external and computed attributes.   instance.getComputedAttribute(key)  and\n    instance.getExternalAttribute(key)  look up computed or external\n   attributes by a given string  key .  instance.setComputedAttribute(key,value)  and\n    instance.setExternalAttribute(key,value)  store computed or external\n   attributes under a given string  key  with value  value , which should be\n   a JSON structure (or atomic data).  No check is made to verify that the\n   value is of this type, but errors will transpire later if this condition\n   is not satisfied (specifically, serialization errors).  instance.clearComputedAttributes(key1,key2,...)  and\n    instance.clearExternalAttributes(key1,key2,...)  remove the key-value\n   pairs of computed or external attributes associated with any of the keys\n   passed as parameters.  It is acceptable to pass any number of keys,\n   including just one.  If zero are passed,  all  key-value pairs are\n   removed.  instance.attr(object)  adds all attributes of the given object as\n   external attributes to the instance, and returns the instance itself.\n   This is useful when constructing hierarchies, as follows.       var A = new Structure(\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { name : 'example structure' } ),\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { color : '#99ff00' } )\n    );   instance.compute(arguments)  is a useful shortcut for storing computed\n   attributes.

These store data about connections between pairs of\nstructures in the same heirarchy.  The data is stored by structure IDs, so\nmaking connections assumes that structures each have a unique ID, as\ndocumented  below .  You can query the connections among structures with these functions:   source.allConnectionsOut(type)  returns a list of all destinations to\n   which the source is connected by one or more connections of the given\n   type.  Each destination appears on the list a number of times equal to\n   the number of connections of the given type from the source to that\n   destination.  destination.allConnectionsIn(type)  functions analogously to the\n   previous, but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a\n   source.  source.allConnectionsOut()  returns a list of destination-type pairs,\n   all connections that go out from the given source structure.  destination.allConnectionsIn()  functions analogously to the previous,\n   but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a source.   To create or destroy connections, use these functions:   source.connectTo(destination,type) , where  source  and  destination \n   are  Structure  instances and  type  is a string containing the type of\n   connection, creates a new connection.  There can be multiple connections\n   between the same two structures, even of the same type.  Returns true if\n   the connection was formed, false if some error prevented it (such as the\n   destination not being a structure, or not having an ID, or the source\n   not having an ID).  source.disconnectFrom(destination,type)  undoes the previous operation.\n   Because there may be multiple connections between the source and\n   destination of the same type, this simply decreases that number by one.\n   Returns true on success or false on failure (for example, if there were\n   no connection to delete).   If the  connectionsOut  and  connectionsIn  data is directly manipulated by\nthe client (not recommended), then you can call  root.fillOutConnections() \nto ensure that the connection data stored in every source matches that\nstored in the corresponding destinations, and vice versa.",

The convention is to store a structure's ID\nin its external attribute with key \"id.\"  For convenience, there is an id()  member function in the structure class that looks up this\nattribute's value.  See more information in the Unique IDs section , below.  Text:   Some structures contain plain text.  The convention is to store\nthese in the external attribute with key \"text.\"  For convenience, there is\na  text()  member function in the structure class that looks up this\nattribute's value.  References:   Some structures serve as references to other structures. They\nare marked as references with the external attribute \"reference.\"  For\nconvenience, there is a  isA()  member function in the structure class that\ncan look up whether this attribute is present, by calling isA('reference') , and thus indicating whether the structure is\nfunctioning as a reference.  Labels:   Get a list of all text values used as labels for a structure by\ncalling its member function  labels() .  There are several ways that a\nstructure can be labeled, all documented in the source code .  All labels are strings.  Check whether a string is on that list with the member function hasLabel(label) .  Reasons and premises:   You can get a list of all reasons or premises\nattached to a structure with the member functions  reasons()  and premises() .  These may be structures or the names by which structures\naccessible to this one are labeled.  There are several ways that a structure\ncan have a reason or premise attached, all documented in the source code .  Citations:   Given a string and a structure  S , you can look up the\nnearest accessible (to  S ) structure that has that string as a label with S.lookup(label) .  We say that one structure cites another if it has that\nother as a reason or premise; you can query this binary relation with structure.cites(other) , and get a list of everything that cites a given\nstructure with  structure.whatCitesMe() .",

Here are the relevant functions:   instance.id()  returns the instance's ID, if it has one, or undefined if\n   not  instance.trackIDs()  asks the class to update the class variable that\n   maps IDs to instances, recording the connection of all IDs for all nodes\n   in the hierarchy whose root is  instance .
