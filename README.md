# Lurch

This repository is becoming the central location for the latest version of the Lurch project.
The migration from three other repositories into this one is still in progress,
but when it completes, it will make it much easier for all that code to work together.

If you're interested in learning more about the project now, please check out
[the project website, here](http://lurchmath.github.io).
