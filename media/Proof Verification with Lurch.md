## Proof Verification with Lurch

Would your students benefit from an easy-to-use, open-source, web-based word processor that could check their assigned mathematical proofs?  In this talk we introduce *Lurch*, our software project designed specifically for this purpose.  In particular, we will discuss how *Lurch* was integrated into an undergraduate introduction to mathematical proof bridge course during the Spring 2024 semester. Additionally, we will explain how you can use this software and accompanying course materials, and customize it for your own purposes. 



## (Meta) True about Everything

How does *Lurch* verify proofs?   In this talk weâ€™ll take a closer look at the theoretical foundations of the *global $n$-compact validation algorithm* developed for *Lurch*.  While existing proof verification software (such as Lean, Isabelle, Coq, and Mizar) are powerful and effective, they often come with a steep learning curve and can be difficult to customize.  We will explain how the custom *Lurch* validation algorithm overcomes these challenges, and pose some questions for future work.
