# LDE Design Phase 7: Features

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Add features to anything built so far (like multiple conclusions from a
   rule, or automatic premise finding, or automatic premise ordering, or
   the ability to specify metavariable instantiations, or any of 1000 other
   features we'd like to add)
 * This enables: everything else
