We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

# LDE Design Phase 10: Declarations

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Variable declarations (which may be a special type of expression, or may
   be a special type of subproof--i.e., do we mark a variable as a
   declaration, or do we mark a subproof as a variable declaration one, and
   then the variable at the start of it is declared?)
 * Examples (structures in which you declare all manner of stuff that
   doesn't bleed out)
 * This enables: predicate logic in standard math notation, and many other
   math topics
