# LDE Design Phase 6: Declarations

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Variable declarations (which may be a special type of expression, or may
   be a special type of subproof--i.e., do we mark a variable as a
   declaration, or do we mark a subproof as a variable declaration one, and
   then the variable at the start of it is declared?)
 * Examples (structures in which you declare all manner of stuff that
   doesn't bleed out)
 * This enables: predicate logic in standard math notation, and many other
   math topics
