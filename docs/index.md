# The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE)

This documentation site contains the design of the LDE.

We will implement that design, and as we do so, the various phases of
development (accessible from the navigation menu above) will be converted
from pages describing the plan into pages describing the completed API.

Use the menu at the top of this site to find content.
