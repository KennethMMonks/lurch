# The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE)

This documentation site will contains the design of the LDE.

Right now, however, it's a placeholder because this branch of the
repository is a reconstruction of most of our work, sort of from scratch.
See the master branch for the old version, or check back later here for the
new one.
