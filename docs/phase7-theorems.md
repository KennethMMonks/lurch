We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

# LDE Design Phase 7: Theorems and Proofs

## Content

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Proofs (which are also subproofs)
 * Theorem statements
 * Pairing of theorems with proofs
 * Homework problems (which may be the same as a theorem-proof pair!)

## Goal

This enables:

 * Proofs
 * Homework assignments

## Status

This phase has not yet been implemented.  Once it has been implemented, its
contents will be documented in the API Documentation available from the
navigation menu at the top of this site.
