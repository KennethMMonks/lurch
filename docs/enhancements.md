# Enhancements for Later

This page lists helpful enhancements to work already completed, but which
were not essential enough to have been included in the work done so far.  We
list them here so as not to lose track of important improvements we might
make later, and we leave empty check boxes next to them so that we can later
mark them complete as they are implemented.

(Entries that were here have been deleted.  This page continues to exist in
the event that it may be used again later for other ideas.)
