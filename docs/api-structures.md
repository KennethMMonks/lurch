## Source Code

 * [The `Structure` class](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee)
 * [Unit tests of the `Structure` class](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/tests/structure-spec.litcoffee)

## Purpose

The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE, [documented here](api-lde.md)) maintains a
document called hte LDE Document, which is a hierarchy (or tree).  The nodes
in that tree are instances of this class (`Structure`) or one of its
subclasses.

We build into this base class all the functionality that must be present at
every point in that hierarchy, and leave to subclasses that functionality
that makes sense only for specific types of structures.  For instance, this
class contains no functionality to support rules of inference, because they
are one specific type of structure, so their functionality will be
implemented in a subclass for that purpose.

## Constructing and Serialization

There is one constructor for the class
([see source code](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#constructor)):

`Structure(child1,child2,...)` creates a new instance, with the given list
of children, each of which must be a `Structure` instance (or it will be
ignored).  All such children are removed from any old parent they had before
being inserted into this newly created one.

Instances can be converted to and from JSON, for saving to a file, storing
permanently anywhere, or transmitting across threads or network connections.
To ensure that deserialization correctly reconstructs instances of the right
subclass of `Structure`, each subclass must be registered.  To do so, we
provide the `addSubclass` function.  Use it like so.

JavaScript:
```js
    MySubclass = function ( /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ };
    // ...
    MySubclass.prototype.className = Structure.addSubclass( 'MySubclass', MySubclass );
```

CoffeeScript, somewhere inside the class definition:
```coffeescript
    class MySubclass extends Structure
        # ...
        className : Structure.addSubclass 'MySubclass', MySubclass
        # ...
```

Then one can serialize and deserialize any hierarchy containing `Structure`
instances, as well as instances of its subclasses, using the member function
`someInstance.toJSON()` (which obviously yields a JSON structure) or the
class function `Structure.fromJSON(data)`, which accepts JSON data created
from the first function.

Serializing a structure preserves its class, its external and computed
attributes ([documented below](#structure-attributes-and-connections)), and
the hierarchy for which it is the root.  Unique IDs
([documented below](#unique-ids)) are not preserved.  Deserializing does not
assign new unique IDs, but the `setup()` function documented under
[the Unique IDs section, below](#unique-ids) can be used to assign new
unique IDs to the nodes in a just-deserialized hierarchy.

## Structure hierarchies

To navigate or alter a hierarchy of `Structure` instances, use the
following member functions present in each instance.

 * `instance.parent()` yields the parent structure, or `null` if there is
   no parent (i.e., the instance is the root of a hierarchy)
 * `instance.children()` yields an array containing the children structures,
   in order, or an empty array if there are none
 * `instance.indexInParent()` yields the index of the child in its parent's
   ordered list of children, or unddefined if the instance has no parent
 * `instance.previousSibling()` and `instance.nextSibling()` yield the
   adjacent structure in the parent's child list, forward or backward, as
   expected, or undefined if there is no such sibling
 * `instance.removeFromParent()` drops the instance from it's parent's list
   of children (thereby decreasing the length of that child list by 1) and
   thus making `instance.parent()` null
 * `instance.removeChild(index)` is a convenience equivalent to
   `instance.children()[index].removeFromParent()`
 * `instance.insertChild(child,index)` expects a structure instance as the
   first argument and an index into the children list as the second.  It
   inserts the new child at that index, thus increasing the number of
   children by 1.  You may use an index equal to the length of the child
   list to append.  The child is removed from its previous parent, if any,
   before being inserted here.
 * `instance.replaceWith(other)` expects another structure instance as its
   argument.  It removes `instance` from its parent, if there is one, and
   then inserts `other` at the same index in the parent, thus replacing
   `instance`.  This has no effect if `instance` has no parent.  It is
   equivalent to successive calls to `removeFromParent()` and
   `insertChild()` at the instance and its parent, respectively.
 * `instance.copy()` makes a deep copy of the instance, including all nodes
   below it in the hierarchy, but not copying their unique IDs (lest they
   become not unique)

The order of nodes in the hierarchy is often important.  We have one simple
order relation on the nodes in the hierarchy, and one more complex.  The
simplest is just whether node A is "earlier than" node B, in the order
induced by an in-order tree traversal (that is, the order in which the open
parentheses would appear if the tree were written as a LISP expression).
This relation can be tested with `instance.isEarlierThan(other)`.

The more complex order relation is accessibility, which we do not define
here, because it is already defined [in the source code
documentation](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#accessibility).
That relation is implemented with the following member functions available
in all instances of the class.

 * `A.isAccessibleTo(B)` implements the relation as defined at the link
   given above.
 * `A.isInTheScopeOf(B)` is equivalent to `B.isAccessibleTo(A)`.
 * `A.iteratorOverAccessibles()` yields an "iterator" object, which is an
   object that can produce the list of nodes accessible to `A` by repeated
   calls to the `next()` member of the object.  Consider the following
   JavaScript code that would use such an iterator.

```js
    var iterator = A.iteratorOverAccessibles();
    var accessible;
    while ( accessible = iterator.next() ) {
        console.log( 'The next accessible structure is:',
            accessible.toJSON() );
    }
```

Nodes are produced by the iterator in reverse order (under the
`isEarlierThan` relation) starting from the first accessible node before
`A`.  When the `next()` function yields null for the first time, the end of
the list has been reached.  (The `next()` function will yield null forever
thereafter.)

Iterators are more efficient than producing the entire list and returning
it, because the client may be seeking just one particular node in the list,
and thus producing the entire list so that the client can search just a
small part of it could be wasteful.

There is an analogous function for scopes.

 * `A.iteratorOverScope()` functions like `A.iteratorOverAccessibles()`, but
   walks forwards through the structure, including precisely those nodes for
   which `B.isInTheScopeOf(A)` holds true.

There are then four functions that use these iterators under the hood.
Clients will most likely wish to use these rather than have direct access
to the iterators.

 * `A.firstAccessible(P)` expects `P` to be a one-place predicate (that is,
   a JavaScript function that can be evaluated on a single argument, and
   yields true or false in each case) and yields the first item on the
   "accessibles" list (as given by `A.iteratorOverAccessibles()`) for which
   `P` yields true.  It returns undefined if there is no such thing.
 * `A.firstInScope(P)` expects `P` to be a one-place predicate, as just
   defined, and behaves just like `firstAccessible()`, except it walks
   through `A.iteratorOverScope()` instead.
 * `A.allAccessibles(P)` expects `P` as in the previous two functions, and
   yields all nodes accessible to `A` that satisfy `P`, in the same order
   they would be reported by `iteratorOverAccessibles()`.
 * `A.allInScope(P)` expects `P` as in the previous two functions, and
   yields all nodes in the scope of `A` that satisfy `P`, in the same order
   they would be reported by `iteratorOverScope()`.

## Structure attributes and connections

### Attributes in general

Structures have two types of attributes, computed and external.  The
distinction is documented in the source code,
[here](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#computed-attributes) and
[here](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#external-attributes).

The following functions available in each instance of the structure class
support external and computed attributes.

 * `instance.getComputedAttribute(key)` and
   `instance.getExternalAttribute(key)` look up computed or external
   attributes by a given string `key`.
 * `instance.setComputedAttribute(key,value)` and
   `instance.setExternalAttribute(key,value)` store computed or external
   attributes under a given string `key` with value `value`, which should be
   a JSON structure (or atomic data).  No check is made to verify that the
   value is of this type, but errors will transpire later if this condition
   is not satisfied (specifically, serialization errors).
 * `instance.clearComputedAttributes(key1,key2,...)` and
   `instance.clearExternalAttributes(key1,key2,...)` remove the key-value
   pairs of computed or external attributes associated with any of the keys
   passed as parameters.  It is acceptable to pass any number of keys,
   including just one.  If zero are passed, *all* key-value pairs are
   removed.
 * `instance.attr(object)` adds all attributes of the given object as
   external attributes to the instance, and returns the instance itself.
   This is useful when constructing hierarchies, as follows.

```js
    var A = new Structure(
        ( new Structure() ).attr( { name : 'example structure' } ),
        ( new Structure() ).attr( { color : '#99ff00' } )
    );
```

 * `instance.compute(arguments)` is a useful shortcut for storing computed
   attributes.  We do not redocument its details here; see the documentation
   in the source code at the end of
   [this section](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#computed-attributes).

### Connections as a type of attribute

Within a structure's external attributes are two key-value pairs that should
not be used for any other purpose, those with keys `connectionsOut` and
`connectionsIn`.  These store data about connections between pairs of
structures in the same heirarchy.  The data is stored by structure IDs, so
making connections assumes that structures each have a unique ID, as
documented [below](#unique-ids).

You can query the connections among structures with these functions:

 * `source.allConnectionsOut(type)` returns a list of all destinations to
   which the source is connected by one or more connections of the given
   type.  Each destination appears on the list a number of times equal to
   the number of connections of the given type from the source to that
   destination.
 * `destination.allConnectionsIn(type)` functions analogously to the
   previous, but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a
   source.
 * `source.allConnectionsOut()` returns a list of destination-type pairs,
   all connections that go out from the given source structure.
 * `destination.allConnectionsIn()` functions analogously to the previous,
   but for connections into a destination, rather than out from a source.
 * `destination.properties()` looks at the set of source structures that
   connect to the destination via arrows, and forms a dictionary of
   key-value pairs, the "properties" of the destination.  The key will be
   the type of the connection and the value will be the array of sources
   that connected to the destination with that connection type.

To create or destroy connections, use these functions:

 * `source.connectTo(destination,type)`, where `source` and `destination`
   are `Structure` instances and `type` is a string containing the type of
   connection, creates a new connection.  There can be multiple connections
   between the same two structures, even of the same type.  Returns true if
   the connection was formed, false if some error prevented it (such as the
   destination not being a structure, or not having an ID, or the source
   not having an ID).
 * `source.disconnectFrom(destination,type)` undoes the previous operation.
   Because there may be multiple connections between the source and
   destination of the same type, this simply decreases that number by one.
   Returns true on success or false on failure (for example, if there were
   no connection to delete).

If the `connectionsOut` and `connectionsIn` data is directly manipulated by
the client (not recommended), then you can call `root.fillOutConnections()`
to ensure that the connection data stored in every source matches that
stored in the corresponding destinations, and vice versa.

### Other attribute conventions

*Text:*  Some structures contain plain text.  The convention is to store
*these in the external attribute with key "text."  For convenience, there is
*a `text()` member function in the structure class that looks up this
*attribute's value.

*References:*  Some structures serve as references to other structures.
*They are marked as references with the external attribute "reference."  For
*convenience, there is a `isAReference()` member function in the structure
*class that looks up whether this attribute is present, and thus the
*structure is functioning as a reference.

*Labels:*  Get a list of all text values used as labels for a structure by
calling its member function `labels()`.  There are several ways that a
structure can be labeled, all documented
[in the source code](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#collecting-labels-reasons-and-premises).  All labels are strings.

Check whether a string is on that list with the member function
`hasLabel(label)`.

*Reasons and premises:*  You can get a list of all reasons or premises
attached to a structure with the member functions `reasons()` and
`premises()`.  These may be structures or the names by which structures
accessible to this one are labeled.  There are several ways that a structure
can have a reason or premise attached, all documented
[in the source code](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee#collecting-labels-reasons-and-premises).

*Citations:*  Given a string and a structure `S`, you can look up the
nearest accessible (to `S`) structure that has that string as a label with
`S.lookup(label)`.  We say that one structure cites another if it has that
other as a reason or premise; you can query this binary relation with
`structure.cites(other)`, and get a list of everything that cites a given
structure with `structure.whatCitesMe()`.

## Unique IDs

The `Structure` class maintains a mapping from nonnegative integer IDs to
instances of the class.  A class, upon construction, doesn't get assigned a
unique ID by default, but you can request one at any time.

Here are the relevant functions:

 * `instance.ID` contains the instance's ID, if it has one, or undefined if
   not
 * `instance.getID()` asks the class to allocate a new, unique ID to the
   instance.  It does nothing if the instance already had an ID.
 * `instance.releaseID()` deletes the ID from the instance and lets the
   class know that the ID is no longer in use, so that it may be assigned to
   another instance later
 * `Structure.instanceWithID(id)` takes a nonnegative integer ID and yields
   the instance with that ID, if there is one, or null or undefined if there
   is none.

If you have a structure hierarchy in which you wish all nodes to have a
unique ID installed, call `setup()` on the root, and it will recursively
call `getID()` in each instance.  It will also call `fillOutConnections()`.
