We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

# LDE Design Phase 8: Expressions

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Expanded form for non-atomic expressions (function applications,
   binding, variables, constants, etc.)
 * Extend rules to pattern-based matching (the usual kind of rules we think
   of in math)
 * This enables: propositional logic, but with statements in expanded form
   only
