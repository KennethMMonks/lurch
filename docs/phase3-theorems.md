# LDE Design Phase 3: Theorems and Proofs

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Proofs (which are also subproofs)
 * Theorem statements
 * Pairing of theorems with proofs
 * Homework problems (which may be the same as a theorem-proof pair!)
 * This enables: well, proofs and homework assignments, I guess
