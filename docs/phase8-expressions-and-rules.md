We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

# LDE Design Phase 8: Expressions and Rules

## Content

In this phase, we define mathematical expressions and rules of inference.

## Goal

The LDE will be able to validate much of the mathematics we expect to use it
for, without yet permitting customizable mathematical notation.

## Status

This phase has been implemented and documented in the API Documentation,
and then was thoroughly overhauled to match a new and updated design.  That
overhaul is complete, and this phase is ready to be used in later phases.
