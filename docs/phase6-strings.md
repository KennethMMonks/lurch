We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Extend rules to include string-based matching (like the kind of matching
   Circle-Dot and MIU use)
 * This enables: toy systems like Circle-Dot and MIU
