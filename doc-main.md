 
## The Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) Source Code Documentation

This repository is in the process of rebuilding the LDE, discarding an old
design and replacing it with a better, updated design.  That work is still in
progress, and is perhaps 50% complete.

The navigation menu on the left shows classes and namespaces in alphabetical
order, but the overview below is more logically organized.

## Code documentation overview

Every symbolic math software needs some data structure for storing trees of
mathematical symbols that represent mathematical meaning.  In the LDE, the
most generic of these is the {@link MathConcept MathConcept}.

Later, complex math concepts will be able to be compiled down to a set of
simpler special cases that can be processed by the LDE.  We call that simpler
subset the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}.

Logic concepts come in four types: {@link Environment Environment},
{@link Formula Formula}, {@link Declaration Declaration}, and
{@link Expression Expression}.

Expressions come in three types: {@link Symbol Symbol},
{@link Application Application}, and {@link Binding Binding}.

There are also some basic tools, including:

 * for {@link Connection connecting} math concept instances irrespective of
   tree structure,
 * for {@link Matching pattern-matching} with math concepts,
 * for working with {@link JSON JSON} and
   {@link predictableStringify serializing it}.
